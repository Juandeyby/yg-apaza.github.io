I was accepted onto  [Outreachy 2017 May-August](https://wiki.gnome.org/Outreachy/2017/MayAugust#Lagom) round. Estar√© trabajando en el proyecto
<!--One week has happened from my internship start, so I'll be working on the Online auction sample app completion.-->

## How can I start to contribute to Online Auction Sample App?

You can find the documentation about how to run the application and how to set up the IDE in the [Github repo](https://github.com/lagom/online-auction-java#getting-started).

Next steps are more about learning and reading the Lagom framework reference guide. Me, as a beginner, found challenging to understand [Event Sourcing and CQRS](https://www.lagomframework.com/documentation/1.3.x/java/ES_CQRS.html), mostly because I was comfortable enough with traditional CRUD model.

## What did I learn before my internship?



## What's next?
